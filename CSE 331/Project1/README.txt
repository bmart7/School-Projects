Name: Brian Martin
Hours to complete project: 2
Feedback: I am learning Python for the first time, so it is nice to have a simple beginning project that I have done before in C++
          to help me understand the language better. I was having a little trouble figuring out what the hidden tests cases were
          testing against in order to fix why they were failing
