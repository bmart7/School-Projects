Project 4


Name: Brian Martin

Time to Complete: 5 hours

Feedback: I enjoyed using the concepts I learned in CSE 260 with modular arithmetic in an actual computing experience.
          I found myself overthinking the is_perfect() method. I thought I would have to check the depth of each leaf
          which would not allow me to be in the time complexity requirement but I figured it out eventually.
